"""Settings window (#100) — a GUI over everything `--setup` configures.

Layers:
    model.py    — config.json <-> `Settings`, validation, save. Pure; tested.
    services.py — OAuth connect + autostart side effects. Toolkit-free.
    window.py   — the tkinter view. Imported only by `run()`, so importing
                  this package never pulls in tkinter (headless boxes and
                  Python builds without Tk keep working).

Entry points: `like-current-song --settings`, and the tray's "Settings…" item,
which launches that same command as a child process (see
`hosts/windows/resident.py` for why it's a process, not a thread).
