"""ArchiveRemoveAction — default flavor PostLikeAction.

Removes the just-liked track from the user's "archive" playlist
(typically a Discover-Weekly snapshot rotation, but the name is
configurable). Spotify-specific by design — the action is in the
Spotify-flavor extensions; non-Spotify providers are silently skipped
so the chain stays composable across flavors.

Idempotency (#23 AC): cache the archive playlist's track set on first
encounter so the per-like path stays free of playlist API calls unless
the track is actually present. The DELETE itself is also idempotent on
Spotify's side, but we want to honour "no playlist API call" when
nothing is there to remove.
