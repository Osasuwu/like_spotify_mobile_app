"""FollowArtistAction — default flavor PostLikeAction (#26).

Records each (user, artist, track) liked combination in Storage; when
a distinct-track count for an artist crosses a configured threshold
(default 5), auto-follow that artist. Idempotency is owned by
`Storage.record_artist_track` (returns the same count when called
twice with the same triple).

Triggers ONLY when the post-record count EQUALS the threshold, so a
6th, 7th… liked track from the same artist does NOT re-follow.

Spotify-specific (uses `follow_artist` on the provider); non-Spotify
providers are a silent no-op. Storage absence is also a silent no-op
— without a persistent counter we have no idempotency guarantee.
