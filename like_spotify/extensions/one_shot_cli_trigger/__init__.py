"""OneShotCliTrigger — second Trigger impl.

Where `TrayHotkeyTrigger` is resident (registers a global hotkey and
sticks around emitting on each press), this one fires exactly once on
`start()` and is done. The user signal is the invocation itself:

    $ like-spotify like-once

Validates that the `Trigger` interface accommodates per-invocation
lifetime alongside the resident tray case. Slice: #27.
