class PreLikeAction(ABC):
    """Hook fired before `MusicProvider.like` is written.

    Returning `False` aborts both the chain and the like itself — the host
    surfaces "Skipped by <ClassName>" feedback and no provider call is made.
    Returning `True` (the default-by-convention) lets the chain proceed.

    Raised exceptions are logged by the pipeline and treated as a *skip
    for this action only* — the chain continues. This keeps a flaky pre-
    action from blocking the user's intent.

    No default impl ships in #23 — this is a contributor seam. Sketches in
    `CONTRIBUTING.md`:

        class BlacklistFilter(PreLikeAction):
            async def run(self, ctx: LikeContext) -> bool:
                return ctx.track.provider_track_id not in self._denied

        class ConfirmPrompt(PreLikeAction):
            async def run(self, ctx: LikeContext) -> bool:
                return await ask_user(f"Like {ctx.track.title}?")

    Each registered action runs sequentially. One action's failure (raised
    exception) is logged by the pipeline and does NOT abort the chain —
    later actions still run. Failures are independent: an action's
    contract is its own to keep.

    Default impls in this repo: `ArchiveRemoveAction`. Promote-to-best-of
    and Follow-artist land in #26.
