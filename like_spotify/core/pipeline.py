    """Remove the currently-playing track from a named playlist — no like.

    Powers the "I don't want this in my Discover Weekly archive" hotkey.
    The like flow's `ArchiveRemoveAction` only fires *after* a like, so it
    can't help with tracks the user dislikes; this is the second intent —
    a separate Trigger wired here lets the user curate a playlist without
    liking the track.

    Provider-agnostic via `PlaylistCapableProvider`: it needs
    `get_currently_playing` (on the `MusicProvider` base) plus
    `find_playlist_by_name` / `remove_track_from_playlist` (the optional
    playlist capability). A provider lacking it gets a clean error
    feedback rather than an exception — keeping `core` free of any
    extension import.

    The resolved playlist id is cached after the first successful lookup.
    A miss (playlist not found, or a lookup error) is *not* cached, and a
    cached id is dropped again if the remove call later fails (the playlist
    may have been deleted/renamed) — so a later press re-resolves. Useful in
    a long-lived tray when the user creates the playlist after launch.
