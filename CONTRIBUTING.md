# Contributing

Thanks for looking! This file collects what's known to be easy to land
(good-first-PR ideas), how the desktop framework is laid out, and how
tests / CI work.

## Repo at a glance

- **Android** (`lib/`, `android/app/src/main/kotlin/…`) — Flutter + Kotlin
  app that listens for headset pause-play patterns. Feature-complete for
  Phase 0.
- **Desktop** (`like_spotify/`) — pluggable Python framework. Default
  flavor is a Windows tray host + global hotkey. Pluggability is what
  the OSS-framework refactor ([#19](https://github.com/Osasuwu/like_spotify_mobile_app/issues/19))
  is about: every concern (`Trigger`, `MusicProvider`, `Storage`,
  `PreLikeAction`, `PostLikeAction`, host) is a small interface in
  `like_spotify/core/`, and concrete implementations live under
  `like_spotify/extensions/` and `like_spotify/hosts/`.

## Desktop layout

```

`hosts/__init__.py` picks the right host at startup via `sys.platform`.
Anything Windows-specific (`winreg`, `winsound`, `ctypes.windll`,
`pystray`) lives in `hosts/windows.py` and the `tray_hotkey_trigger`
extension — never in `core/`.

## Good-first-PR ideas

### `hosts/macos.py` — native tray host for macOS

Today macOS gets the `_stub` host: `like-spotify --setup` and
`like-spotify like-once` work; the resident tray does not. A native
macOS host would:

- Render a menu-bar icon (`rumps` is the easy path, `pyobjc` if you want
  no extra deps).
- Register a global hotkey (`pynput` works; check the accessibility
  permission flow).
- Install a Launch Agent for autostart, or print clean instructions for
  the user to copy a plist into `~/Library/LaunchAgents/` — explicit is
  fine, we don't ship a Launch Agent automatically.
- Reuse everything in `hosts/_common.py` — pipeline wiring, setup
  flow, config paths.

Mirror `hosts/windows.py` for shape; aim for ~200 LOC. Hook it up by
extending the dispatch in `hosts/__init__.py::select_host`.

### `hosts/linux.py` — Linux tray host

Same shape as macOS:

- Tray icon via `pystray` (works on common DEs with an
  `AppIndicator3`/`StatusNotifierItem` daemon — Gnome needs the
  AppIndicator extension; KDE works out of the box).
- Global hotkey — the existing `keyboard` library needs root on Linux,
  so prefer `pynput` (X11/Wayland) or document the limitation.
- Autostart via a generated `.desktop` file in
  `~/.config/autostart/`.
- Same `_common` wiring as the other hosts.

### Smaller wins

- **`Storage` impls** — anything tabular works. Already shipped:
  Supabase + Google Sheets. Wanted: SQLite (zero-config local) for users
  who don't want a cloud backend.
- **`Trigger` impls** — global hotkey is one signal source; an MQTT
  trigger or a "shake your phone" → webhook flow would be a fun second
  resident trigger.
- **`PostLikeAction` impls** — anything that wants to react to a like.
  Mood tagging, last.fm scrobble fix-up, "send to a friend's queue", etc.

## Plugin-author guide

The desktop framework has five extension points. Each one is a small
ABC under `like_spotify/core/`; concrete impls live in
`like_spotify/extensions/<your_domain>/`. The host discovers extensions
via a filesystem convention (manifest + module-level factory) —
modelled on Music Assistant's provider layout, with a typed-base per
seam instead of a single generic `Plugin` (see
[docs/design/interfaces.md](docs/design/interfaces.md) §1 for the
prior-art comparison and why we chose this shape over Pano's closed
enum or MA's single-bag plugin).

### Anatomy of an extension

Every extension folder has the same shape:

```
like_spotify/extensions/<your_domain>/
├── __init__.py     # the class + a module-level factory
└── manifest.json   # static metadata for the host
```

The factory name is fixed per extension point — `TRIGGER`,
`MUSIC_PROVIDER`, `STORAGE`, `PRE_LIKE_ACTION`, or `POST_LIKE_ACTION`
— and it's a plain callable that returns one configured instance.
The host imports the package and calls the factory with whatever
kwargs the manifest declares.

Example manifest:

```json
{
  "domain": "volume_button_trigger",
  "extension_point": "trigger",
  "name": "Volume Buttons",
  "description": "Listen for vol-up-up on a connected MIDI / HID device and emit a like intent.",
  "codeowners": ["@you"],
  "requirements": ["hid>=1.0"],
  "documentation": "https://github.com/Osasuwu/like_spotify_mobile_app/blob/main/like_spotify/extensions/volume_button_trigger/README.md",
  "stage": "experimental"
}
```

`stage` is one of `experimental | stable | deprecated`. `requirements`
is pip-compatible — the install bootstrap (see `install.ps1` / `install.sh`)
resolves them at first enable.

### 1. `Trigger` — emit a like intent

```python
# like_spotify/core/trigger.py (already shipped)
class Trigger(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def start(self, emit: EmitFn) -> None: ...
    @abstractmethod
    async def stop(self) -> None: ...
```

`start(emit)` is called once. Long-lived triggers register a listener
(global hotkey, system-tray menu item, MQTT subscription, MIDI HID
read loop) and call `emit()` each time the user signals "like the
playing track". One-shot triggers (`OneShotCliTrigger`) `await emit()`
inside `start` and return. `stop()` must be idempotent.

Existing impls:

- `tray_hotkey_trigger` — global keyboard hotkey (Windows).
- `one_shot_cli_trigger` — per-invocation, any OS.

**Skeleton for a third trigger (good-first-PR — `VolumeButtonTrigger`):**

```python
# like_spotify/extensions/volume_button_trigger/__init__.py
"""VolumeButtonTrigger — emit a like intent on a vol-up-up double-tap.

Watches an HID device for media-volume-up events. Two presses inside
DOUBLE_TAP_WINDOW_MS count as a like signal — single presses still
adjust system volume normally because we don't suppress them.

Status: skeleton only — the HID device discovery + event-loop are
TODOs. Pick this up by:

  1. Decide your HID library (hidapi via `pip install hid`, or evdev on
     Linux). Document it in `manifest.json::requirements`.
  2. Implement `_listen` as an asyncio task that reads HID events and
     calls `self._on_volume_up` on each press.
  3. Match the "two presses in N ms" pattern (mirror the Android
     `MediaEventPatternDetector.kt` logic — same domain shape, just
     translated to Python).
  4. Tests: feed synthetic timestamps to `_on_volume_up` and assert
     `emit` is called exactly once per matched double-tap, never on
     a single press, never on three presses spaced > window.

Acceptance: vol-up-up likes the playing track; single vol-up still
changes system volume. No state shared with TrayHotkeyTrigger.

            and (now_ms - self._last_press_ms) <= self._window_ms

            return
        self._last_press_ms = now_ms


def TRIGGER(**_cfg) -> VolumeButtonTrigger:
    return VolumeButtonTrigger()
```

### 2. `MusicProvider` — read playback + write a like

```python
# like_spotify/core/music_provider.py
class MusicProvider(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def get_currently_playing(self) -> CurrentTrack | None: ...
    @abstractmethod
    async def like(self, track: CurrentTrack) -> None: ...
    @abstractmethod
    async def is_liked(self, track: CurrentTrack) -> bool: ...
    @abstractmethod
    async def user_id(self) -> str: ...
```

Most second providers won't ship in Phase 1 (Spotify owns the world for
this app), but the seam is wide enough to wrap YouTube Music, Tidal,
or local Mopidy. Adding one is the second-implementation moment for
this interface — refactoring around it is welcomed.

OAuth flows belong inside the extension. See `extensions/spotify/`
for a PKCE example (~70 LOC) and `like_spotify/auth/google.py` for an
installed-app OAuth pattern with refresh.

### 3. `Storage` — count likes across devices

```python
# like_spotify/core/storage.py
class Storage(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def increment(
        self, user_id: str, track: CurrentTrack, was_already_liked: bool = False
    ) -> int: ...
    @abstractmethod
    async def get_count(self, user_id: str, track: CurrentTrack) -> int: ...
    @abstractmethod
    async def record_artist_track(
        self, user_id: str, artist_id: str, track_id: str
    ) -> int: ...
```

`increment` is the hot path; it must be safe to call concurrently from
multiple devices and return the new count. `was_already_liked` is the
backfill flag — on first encounter with `True`, seed `count=2` and a
`backfilled=TRUE` marker, otherwise `count=1`. See
[#24](https://github.com/Osasuwu/like_spotify_mobile_app/issues/24)
for why this exists.

**Existing impls** (≥2, so the abstraction is real):

- `supabase_storage` — Postgres RPC (`increment_track_like`).
- `google_sheets_storage` — REST PUT/APPEND on a sheet.

**Wanted next** (good-first-PR): `sqlite_storage` for users who don't
want a cloud backend. The shared contract test in
`tests/test_storage_contract.py` is parametrised over
`(SupabaseStorage | GoogleSheetsStorage)` already — drop a SQLite
fixture in there and you get all seven invariants for free.

### 4. `PreLikeAction` — veto a like before it happens

```python
# like_spotify/core/actions.py
class PreLikeAction(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def run(self, ctx: LikeContext) -> bool: ...
```

Returning `False` aborts the like (feedback shows "Skipped by
`<ActionName>`"). Pre-actions are independent: a raising pre-action is
logged and skipped, later pre-actions still run, the like still
proceeds. **Independence is the contract** — if you need a hard veto
that survives a raise, raise from inside `run` and the host will catch
it; but plan around that as the rare case.

No `PreLikeAction` ships in default flavor yet — first impl is the
obvious good-first-PR. Examples: "skip likes on tracks shorter than
30s", "skip on the first 10s of a track (probably a misclick)".

### 5. `PostLikeAction` — react to a successful like

```python
class PostLikeAction(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def run(self, ctx: LikeContext) -> None: ...
```

Each action runs independently; a raise is logged and the chain
continues (mirrors the Pre-action rule). The `ctx.like_count` field
is populated by Storage *before* the post-chain runs — that's how
`PromoteToBestOfAction` gates on "liked 3+ times".

Existing impls: `archive_remove`, `promote_to_best_of`, `follow_artist`.

**Provider-aware actions** downcast: if your action needs a
Spotify-only API (e.g. playlist manipulation), check
`isinstance(ctx.music_provider, SpotifyMusicProvider)` and use its
provider-specific methods. Ship the action in a folder coupled to the
provider's name, so the soft dependency is visible.

## Adding an extension — checklist

1. Create `like_spotify/extensions/<your_domain>/__init__.py` with the
   concrete class and the matching top-level factory name (`TRIGGER`,
   `MUSIC_PROVIDER`, `STORAGE`, `PRE_LIKE_ACTION`, or
   `POST_LIKE_ACTION`).
2. Create `manifest.json` next to it. The required keys are
   `domain`, `extension_point`, `name`, `description`,
   `codeowners`, `requirements`, and `stage`.
3. Register the manifest in `pyproject.toml`'s
   `[tool.setuptools.package-data]` block so it ships in the wheel.
4. If the extension needs configuration, prompt for it in
   `like_spotify/hosts/_common.py::do_setup` (the wizard) and read it
   from `cfg` in the relevant `_build_*` helper.
5. Tests under `tests/`. For `Storage`, drop your fixture into the
   parametrised contract suite (`tests/test_storage_contract.py`). For
   everything else, small async unit tests against the interface +
   one slice in `tests/test_pipeline.py` if the host wiring is novel.

## Running tests

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
pytest                  # all tests
pytest tests/test_pipeline.py -k storage   # one slice
flutter test            # Android tests
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) currently runs only the Flutter side on
push/PR to `main`. Adding a Python job is itself a good first PR.

## Conventions

- Cross-platform helpers in `hosts/_common.py`; OS-bound side effects
  in `hosts/<platform>.py`. **No `winreg` / `winsound` / `ctypes.windll`
  outside `hosts/windows.py`.**
- Each `PostLikeAction` is independent — a failure must not abort the
  chain (see `like_spotify/core/pipeline.py`).
- "Abstractions need two real implementations" — when you add an
  interface, also ship the second concrete impl (or wait until you
  have a second use case in hand).
- Issues drive scope; the design lives in issue bodies. Decisions live
  in commit messages and the design docs under `docs/design/`.
