## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.3] - 2026-09-01

### Fixed

- **Desktop: no more console flashes.** The packaged entry point is now a
  windowed `gui-scripts` entry, so the tray host no longer spawns a visible
  console window on launch or on each hotkey press ([#68](https://github.com/Osasuwu/like_spotify_mobile_app/issues/68)).

### Changed

- Repo baseline synced — CI workflows, PR body check, and owner-queue guard
  brought in line with the shared template ([#65](https://github.com/Osasuwu/like_spotify_mobile_app/pull/65)).

### Documentation

- Added `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`, this changelog, a feature-request
  issue template, and README status badges; corrected a stale CI claim in
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` ([#70](https://github.com/Osasuwu/like_spotify_mobile_app/issues/70)).

## [1.0.2] - 2026-08-13

Desktop crash fix plus the close-out of a five-finding architecture review pass.
No user-facing behavior changes beyond the crash fix.

### Fixed

- **Tray beep crash.** `winsound` rejects `SND_MEMORY | SND_ASYNC` outright, so
  every like/error beep on desktop crashed with
  `RuntimeError: Cannot play asynchronously from memory`. Dropped the redundant
  `SND_ASYNC` flag — `_beep` already runs on its own daemon thread.
- Like-cooldown gate and recorder now share one store, removing a fragile
  pre/post-action coupling that risked silent desync between the dedup check and
  the record write ([#57](https://github.com/Osasuwu/like_spotify_mobile_app/issues/57)).

### Changed

- `hosts/windows.py` split into a package — tray feedback, tone synthesis,
  autostart, and resident wiring each got their own module instead of one
  687-line grab-bag ([#55](https://github.com/Osasuwu/like_spotify_mobile_app/issues/55)).
- `hosts/_common.py` decomposed into a builder registry; the interactive
  `--setup` wizard extracted to its own module. Adding an extension is now one
  function plus one registry entry, not a new `if`/`elif` branch
  ([#58](https://github.com/Osasuwu/like_spotify_mobile_app/issues/58)).
- `PlaylistCapableProvider` protocol replaces three independent duck-typing
  checks with one structural-typing `Protocol`, applied consistently across the
  remove-from-playlist pipeline, archive-remove action, and follow-artist action
  ([#59](https://github.com/Osasuwu/like_spotify_mobile_app/issues/59)).

### Added

- Regression tests for `TrayFeedback._beep` / `_synth_tone`, covering the crash
  above ([#56](https://github.com/Osasuwu/like_spotify_mobile_app/issues/56)).

## [1.0.1] - 2026-08-06

### Added

- **Like cooldown / dedup.** A 10-minute (configurable) cooldown against
  accidental repeat-likes on the same track — two presses seconds apart during
  one listen now count as one like instead of two.
  - *Android*: `RuleConfig.likeCooldownEnabled` / `likeCooldownMinutes`
    (default 10). Checked before liking, recorded only after the real Spotify
    like call succeeds — mirrored in the native Kotlin WorkManager background
    path.
  - *Desktop*: `like_spotify/extensions/like_cooldown`, a pre/post action pair
    backed by a local JSON store under `~/.like_spotify/`. No Storage or network
    round-trip; same 10-minute default.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-05

First tagged release.

### Added

- Android and Windows media-button triggers for Spotify like/unlike, playlist
  archiving, best-of promotion, and artist auto-follow.
- Desktop tray feedback tone — synthesized, distinctive, volume-configurable
  via `trigger.feedback_volume` in `~/.like_spotify/config.json`.
- Matching Android feedback-volume setting in the Trigger configuration screen.
