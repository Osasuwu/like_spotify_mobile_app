"""Tests for `hosts/_common.py`'s `build_action_chains` (issue #57).

`build_pre_actions` and `build_post_actions` used to each independently call
`build_like_cooldown`, constructing two separate `_CooldownStore` instances
for the gate and the recorder. They happened to converge on the same JSON
file, but nothing enforced that a caller wired both halves onto the same
`Pipeline` — a future host could build one chain and forget the other.
`build_action_chains` replaces both with a single call that returns the gate
and recorder built from one shared store.
