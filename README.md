Heard a song you love while your phone is in your pocket with the screen off? **Pause and resume it with your headphone button** (e.g. pause → play), and the track is saved to your Spotify **Liked Songs**. You don't unlock the phone, look at the screen, or open the Spotify app.

At your computer, a **global keyboard shortcut** does the same thing: press `Ctrl+Shift+Alt+W` while Spotify plays in the background, and the current song is liked without switching away from the app you're working in.

- **Android**: works with the screen off and the phone locked. It reacts to Spotify's pause/play state, so anything that pauses and resumes playback can trigger it: wired or Bluetooth headphones, earbud taps, a smartwatch, or a car stereo. The pattern is configurable, and a short sound confirms the like.
- **Windows**: a tray app with a global hotkey to like the current track, plus a second hotkey to remove it from a playlist.
- **macOS / Linux**: a `like-current-song like-once` command you can bind to any shortcut.
- **Beyond "like"** (optional rules): remove the track from a Discover Weekly archive playlist, promote it to a "best-of" playlist after you like it N times across devices, and auto-follow an artist after N liked tracks. Counters are stored in Supabase or Google Sheets, so your phone and computer see the same numbers.

Open source (MIT). It uses the official Spotify Web API with your own Spotify Developer app. There's no UI scraping, and your tokens stay on your devices.

For developers: the desktop side is a **pluggable framework** with five extension points (`Trigger`, `MusicProvider`, `Storage`, `PreLikeAction`, `PostLikeAction`) discovered from `manifest.json` folders. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## FAQ

### Can I like a Spotify song without unlocking my phone?
Yes, that's the main use case. Install the Android app, connect Spotify, and turn on the listener service. With the screen off, do the trigger pattern with your headphone button (default: pause, then play within a short window), and the current track goes to Liked Songs.

### Does it work with Bluetooth headphones, earbuds, or a smartwatch?
Yes. The app watches Spotify's playback state rather than one specific button, so any device that pauses and resumes Spotify works.

### Is there a global keyboard shortcut to like the current Spotify song on Windows?
Yes. The Windows tray host binds `Ctrl+Shift+Alt+W` (configurable) to "save current track to Liked Songs", and it works while Spotify is minimized or in the background. On macOS and Linux, bind `like-current-song like-once` to a shortcut in your OS settings, Raycast, skhd, or similar.

### Can it add the song to a playlist too, not only Liked Songs?
Yes, through the rule engine: it can promote a track to a "best-of" playlist after N likes and remove it from an archive playlist. New actions are small Python plugins.

### Does it work on iPhone?
No. iOS doesn't let third-party apps observe another app's playback in the background. Android and desktop only.

## По-русски

**Like Spotify** лайкает трек в Spotify, не доставая телефон: нажмите пауза → плей на наушниках, и песня попадёт в «Любимые треки», даже с выключенным экраном и заблокированным телефоном. Работает с любыми наушниками (проводными и Bluetooth), часами и магнитолой. На компьютере (Windows) то же самое делает глобальная горячая клавиша `Ctrl+Shift+Alt+W`, пока Spotify играет в фоне. Открытый исходный код, лицензия MIT.

## How it works

1. **Trigger** — pause-play your headset (Android) or press a hotkey (desktop)
2. **Like** — the current track is added to your Spotify Liked Songs
3. **Archive cleanup** — if the track is in your archive playlist, it gets removed
4. **Best-of promotion** — like a track 3 times across devices and it's added to your best-of playlist
5. **Artist follow** — like 5+ tracks from an artist and they get auto-followed

Steps 3–5 are optional and off until you set them up. On Android they live
under **Trigger configuration → Extra actions**.

## How it compares

Several desktop hotkey tools can like the current Spotify song. We haven't found another open-source project that does it **from a phone with the screen off**, or one that covers phone and desktop with shared rules. If you only need a Windows hotkey, the smaller tools below may fit you better.

| Project | One-press like | Headset trigger (phone) | Hotkey trigger (desktop) | Rule engine (archive/best-of/follow) | Cross-device counters | Pluggable | Use **theirs** when |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Like Spotify** (this) | ✓ | ✓ Android | ✓ Windows tray + mac/linux CLI | ✓ | ✓ Supabase / Sheets | ✓ 5 typed seams + manifest discovery | n/a |
| [Pano Scrobbler](https://github.com/kawaiiDango/pano-scrobbler) | partial (love via UI) | — (notification scrape) | — | — (scrobble target only) | — | provider seam only (write target) | you want **scrobbling history** to last.fm/listenbrainz/librefm/pleroma. Pano is the right answer for "where did my listens go" — we don't try to replace it. |
| [BeatBind](https://github.com/justinknguyen/BeatBind) | ✓ (save / remove) | — | ✓ Windows tray (.NET) | — | — | — | you want a polished **Windows-only** global-hotkey app for full playback control (play/pause, skip, volume, seek) as well as saving tracks. |
| [Spotikey](https://github.com/dannj90/Spotikey) | ✓ | — | ✓ Windows (`Ctrl+Alt+L`) | — | — | — | you want **only** a like hotkey, as a single small executable. |
| [SpotiLike-GUI](https://github.com/senuka-b/SpotiLike-GUI) | ✓ (to a playlist) | — | ✓ desktop (PyQt) | — | — | — | you want one hotkey per **target playlist** and a GUI to manage them. |
| [SpotifyHotKeys.ahk](https://github.com/rjmccallumbigl/SpotifyHotKeys.ahk) | ✓ (like / unlike) | — | ✓ Windows only (AutoHotKey) | — | — | — | you already live in AutoHotKey and want a small single-file script you can paste & edit. We're heavier (Python install) but cross-platform and rule-capable. |
| [Music Assistant](https://www.music-assistant.io/) | partial (per-provider) | — | via Home Assistant | extensive (queue / library / sync) | — (per-instance) | ✓ ~60 providers | you want **Home Assistant-grade music orchestration** — multi-provider library merging, multi-room sync, queue scripting. We don't try to be your music server; we sit next to your existing Spotify client. |
| [n8n](https://n8n.io/) / Zapier / IFTTT | only via polling | — | — | yes (general workflows) | yes (workflow vars) | ✓ generic | you want **a generic workflow engine** with a UI and 400+ integrations. We're the inverse — narrow to "like + post-like rules", but one button press and ~30 ms latency vs minutes of polling. |

## Quick start

### 1. Spotify Developer App

1. Go to [developer.spotify.com/dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Create an app
3. Add redirect URIs:
   - `likespotify://auth-callback` (Android)
   - `http://127.0.0.1:8793/callback` (Desktop)
4. Copy your Client ID

### 2. Android

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/Osasuwu/like-current-song.git
cd like-current-song

# Configure
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID (and optionally SUPABASE_URL/KEY)

# Build
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --release --dart-define-from-file=.env
```

Install the APK, connect Spotify in the app, enable the listener service.

### 3. Desktop

The desktop side ships as a pluggable Python package (`like_spotify/`) —
a tray host + global hotkey on Windows, a CLI fallback (`like-once`) on
macOS / Linux, and a multi-backend counter Storage (Supabase or Google
Sheets).

**One-liner installs.** Run from a fresh clone:

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
git clone https://github.com/Osasuwu/like-current-song.git
cd like-current-song
.\install.ps1
```

```bash
# macOS / Linux
git clone https://github.com/Osasuwu/like-current-song.git
cd like-current-song
./install.sh
```

The installer checks for Python 3.11+, installs `pipx` if missing,
installs the `like-current-song` package, then walks you through the
interactive setup wizard:

1. **Spotify** — paste a Client ID from
   [developer.spotify.com/dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
   (redirect URI: `http://127.0.0.1:8793/callback`); a browser opens
   for PKCE OAuth.
2. **Storage** — pick `supabase`, `sheets`, or `none` (likes work
   without a counter; you'd just lose cross-device aggregation).
3. **Autostart** — Windows: toggle the `HKCU\…\Run` entry. macOS /
   Linux: instructions for a Launch Agent / `.desktop` file are
   printed (no auto-config — too platform-fragmented).

The wizard is re-runnable; existing tokens are kept unless you pass
`--reauth` (or `-Reauth` on PowerShell).

**After install:**

```bash
like-current-song             # Windows: tray host with the hotkey (default Ctrl+Shift+Alt+W)
like-current-song like-once   # any OS: like the currently-playing track and exit
like-current-song remove-once # any OS: remove the current track from the archive playlist (no like)
like-current-song --config    # print config + token paths
like-current-song --settings  # open the settings window
```

**Upgrading from `like-spotify`.** The package and commands used to be
called `like-spotify` / `like-spotify-gui`. Re-run the installer: it
removes the old pipx package and installs `like-current-song`. Your config
and tokens in `~/.like_spotify/` stay where they are. The old command names
still work for now (the console one prints a short note), but they will be
removed in a future release, so update any scripts or hotkey tools. On
Windows, an autostart entry from the old version is moved to the new
launcher the next time the tray starts, or when `--setup` asks about
autostart.

**Settings window.** Everything the wizard asks, in one window instead of a
terminal: the music service and the account sign-in (the same browser flow
as `--setup`), the hotkeys, the sound volume (with a Test button), the like
counter storage, and autostart. The optional **Extra actions** (archive
clean-up, best-of, follow artist, like cooldown) sit in a collapsed
section, each with a one-line explanation. On a fresh install they all
start switched off. On Windows, open it from the tray menu (**Settings…**).
Saved changes apply right away, hotkeys included. If the new settings can't
run yet (for example, you switched service but haven't signed in), the tray
keeps the old ones and tells you why. If a change can't be applied live, it
offers to restart. From a terminal, run `like-current-song --settings` (or
`like-current-song-gui --settings`). It needs Tk: on Linux, install your
distro's `python3-tk` package. The window only edits the keys it knows, so
anything else you added to `config.json` by hand is kept as is.

`like-current-song` is a console-subsystem executable, so any of the above
briefly shows a terminal window. On Windows, a windowed twin is also
installed — `like-current-song-gui` — that runs the exact same commands with no
console at all. Autostart uses it automatically; if you trigger `like-once`
/ `remove-once` from an external hotkey tool (AutoHotkey, a macro app, a
Stream Deck, etc.), point it at `like-current-song-gui like-once` instead of
`like-current-song like-once` to avoid the flash. (`--setup` / `--config` still
need `like-current-song`, since they read from the terminal.)

On Windows the tray host also binds a **second** global hotkey (default
`Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Q`) that removes the currently-playing track from your
Discover-Weekly archive playlist **without liking it** — for tracks you
want gone but not in your Liked Songs. It's active only once you set an
archive playlist name in `--setup`; if it collides with the like hotkey
it's skipped. Audio feedback is audible through the default sound device
and distinct per action (like / remove / error).

**YouTube Music (beta, Windows).** Choose `ytmusic` at the "Music service"
prompt in `--setup`. The hotkey then likes the song playing in the YT Music
browser tab or desktop app, and it lands in YT Music's *Liked music*. You need
your own free Google OAuth client with the YouTube Data API enabled; the steps
are in [`extensions/ytmusic/README.md`](like_spotify/extensions/ytmusic/README.md).
The playlist actions (archive-remove, best-of, follow-artist) work there too.
Follow-artist subscribes to the artist's channel, and each playlist write
costs YouTube API quota (see that README).

**Single-file `.exe`** (for users without Python): build via
`tools\build.bat` → `dist\LikeSpotify.exe`.

### 4. Cross-device counters (optional)

Pick a backend during `--setup`:

#### Option A — Supabase (default; one SQL block)

Counters live in Supabase Postgres (free tier).

1. Create a Supabase project
2. Run the setup SQL:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE public.track_likes (
       user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
       track_id TEXT NOT NULL,
       count INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
       updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
       PRIMARY KEY (user_id, track_id)
   );

   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION increment_track_like(p_user_id TEXT, p_track_id TEXT)
   RETURNS INTEGER LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER AS $$
   DECLARE new_count INTEGER;
   BEGIN
       INSERT INTO public.track_likes (user_id, track_id, count, updated_at)
       VALUES (p_user_id, p_track_id, 1, now())
       ON CONFLICT (user_id, track_id)
       DO UPDATE SET count = track_likes.count + 1, updated_at = now()
       RETURNING count INTO new_count;
       RETURN new_count;
   END; $$;

   ALTER TABLE public.track_likes ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   CREATE POLICY "anon_full_access" ON public.track_likes FOR ALL USING (true) WITH CHECK (true);
   ```
3. Android: add `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` to `.env`. Desktop: paste both into the wizard when prompted for the `supabase` backend.

#### Option B — Google Sheets

If you'd rather see counts in a spreadsheet you control:

1. Create a Google Sheet with header row `user_id | track_id | count | backfilled | updated_at` on a tab named `Likes`. Optionally add an `ArtistTracks` tab for the follow-artist rule.
2. Create a Google Cloud OAuth client (type: **Desktop app**) at [console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials). Enable the Google Sheets API for the project. Note the Client ID + secret.
3. Run `like-current-song --setup`, pick `sheets`, paste the spreadsheet ID (from the URL), Client ID, and secret. A browser opens for Google authorization — tokens are refreshed automatically afterwards.

Without a backend, counters are silently skipped — likes still write to your Spotify Liked Songs.

## Configuration

Every desktop setting below except the token files can be changed in the
settings window (`like-current-song --settings`, or **Settings…** in the tray menu).

| Setting | Android | Desktop |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Trigger pattern / hotkey | In-app UI | `~/.like_spotify/config.json` → `trigger.hotkey` (default `Ctrl+Shift+Alt+W`) |
| Remove-from-archive hotkey | n/a (one trigger on headphones) | `~/.like_spotify/config.json` → `trigger.remove_hotkey` (default `Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Q`) |
| Archive playlist name | In-app UI | `~/.like_spotify/config.json` → `actions.archive_remove.playlist_name` (blank = archive-remove disabled) |
| Music service | Spotify | `~/.like_spotify/config.json` → `music.provider` (`spotify` / `ytmusic`, default `spotify`) |
| YouTube Music tokens | n/a (planned) | `~/.like_spotify/youtube_token.json` (refreshed automatically) |
| Spotify client_id | `.env` (`SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`) | `like-current-song --setup` → `~/.like_spotify/config.json` |
| Spotify tokens | `FlutterSecureStorage` | `~/.like_spotify/spotify_token.json` |
| Storage backend | (Supabase only) | `~/.like_spotify/config.json` → `storage.backend` (`supabase` / `sheets` / `none`) |
| Google Sheets tokens | n/a | `~/.like_spotify/google_token.json` (refreshed automatically) |
| Best-of / follow | In-app UI | `~/.like_spotify/config.json` → `actions.{promote_to_best_of,follow_artist}` |
